            <p>“ActionAid believes that every girl has the right to go to school. Every girl has the power to transform her own future, and build a life free from poverty – if only she’s given the chance.  
                That’s why we run a network of projects that support girls into schools, keep girls from dropping out of school, and help girls to catch up on learning they’ve missed. This includes simple solutions, like providing menstrual products, so that period poverty doesn't force girls to miss out on school.”

            <p>ActionAid provides training on how to make reusable sanitary pads, which are affordable and sustainable. They support girls' clubs where girls learn about their bodies, menstruation and health, build confidence and come together to advocate for their rights. They also support girls' rooms in schools, which provide a safe, private space and access to products, helping girls manage their periods freely and without shame. In humanitarian crises, they distribute kits containing menstrual products, soap and clean underwear, so women, girls and people who menstruate can manage their periods safely and with dignity. And they’re working with local communities to end the practice of chhaupadi - a period-shaming tradition in Nepal - for good.</p>
